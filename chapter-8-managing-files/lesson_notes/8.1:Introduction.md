# 8.1 Introduction to Managing Files in Linux

When working in a Linux Operating System, it is essential to understand how to manipulate files and directories. File management is one of the most fundamental skills in Linux, as nearly all tasks—whether system administration, software development, or general usage—require interacting with files and folders.

While many Linux distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora provide graphical user interface (GUI) applications for managing files (such as file managers), it is highly advantageous to know how to perform these operations via the command line.

The command line offers:

* Greater control and precision
* Faster execution of repetitive tasks
* The ability to work on remote systems
* Access to powerful automation tools (e.g., scripts)

Understanding file management from the terminal is a core Linux skill.

## Case Sensitivity in Linux

One of the most important concepts to remember when managing files in Linux is:

> **Everything in Linux is case-sensitive.**

This feature is inherited from the original Unix operating system.

### What Does Case-Sensitive Mean?

The shell treats lowercase letters (`a-z`) and uppercase letters (`A-Z`) as completely different characters.

For example, the following filenames are all different:

```
hello.txt
HELLO.txt
Hello.txt
```

Even though they look similar, Linux sees them as three separate files.

### Why This Matters

When manipulating files:

* Typing the wrong capitalization will result in an error.
* Commands may fail if the filename case does not match exactly.
* Directories must also be referenced with exact case.

Example:

```bash
ls Documents
```

is different from:

```bash
ls documents
```

If only one of these directories exists, the other command will produce an error.

Always pay close attention to capitalization when working in the shell.

## Linux Character Standards (UTF-8 and ASCII)

Linux systems use the **UTF-8** character encoding standard.

### UTF-8

UTF-8 is a universal character encoding system that:

* Supports virtually all characters from all writing systems
* Is backward compatible with ASCII
* Is widely used in modern operating systems and applications

### ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

UTF-8 is based on ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

ASCII defines numeric codes for:

* Letters (A–Z, a–z)
* Numbers (0–9)
* Punctuation symbols
* Control characters

For example:

* The letter `A` has an ASCII value of 65
* The letter `a` has an ASCII value of 97

This numeric representation allows computers to store and interpret text data consistently.

## Viewing ASCII Information in Linux

You can learn more about ASCII directly from your Linux system using the `man` (manual) command.

To view ASCII documentation, run:

```bash
man -s 7 ascii
```

### Explanation of the Command:

* `man` → Opens the manual page
* `-s 7` → Specifies section 7 (miscellaneous information, including standards)
* `ascii` → The topic to view

This command displays the ASCII character table and detailed information about character encoding.

## Summary

When managing files in Linux:

* You can use GUI tools, but command-line skills are essential.
* Linux is **case-sensitive** — capitalization matters.
* The system uses **UTF-8** encoding, based on ASCII.
* You can explore ASCII details using:

```bash
man -s 7 ascii
```

Mastering these foundational concepts prepares you for more advanced file management tasks such as creating, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and directories from the Linux command line.
