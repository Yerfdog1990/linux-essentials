# 8.6 Removing Files

In Linux, files are deleted using the `rm` (remove) command. Unlike many graphical operating systems, the command line does **not** move files to a trash can. Once removed, files are permanently deleted.

---

## Removing Files with `rm`

### Example

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  hosts.copy
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     sample

sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm sample
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm hosts.copy

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

Notice:

* The files `sample` and `hosts.copy` were removed.
* The system did **not** ask for confirmation.
* The files no longer appear in the directory listing.

---

## ⚠ Important Warning

When using `rm`:

* Files are **permanently deleted**.
* There is **no undelete command**.
* There is **no trash can** from which to recover deleted files.

This makes `rm` a very powerful and potentially dangerous command.

---

## The Danger of Using Wildcards (Glob Characters)

When deleting multiple files using glob characters such as `*`, the system will remove all matching files **without asking for confirmation**.

This can cause serious problems if:

* The wildcard matches more files than intended.
* A typo is made in the command.
* You are working in the wrong directory.

Because of this risk, precautions should be taken.

---

## Using the `-i` (Interactive) Option

To prevent accidental deletion, use the `-i` option. This makes `rm` prompt before removing each file.

### Example

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch sample.txt example.txt test.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  example.txt  test.txt
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     sample.txt

sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm -i *.txt
rm: remove regular empty file `example.txt'? y
rm: remove regular empty file `sample.txt'? n
rm: remove regular empty file `test.txt'? y
```

Explanation:

* `y` = Yes, delete the file.
* `n` = No, keep the file.

After running the command:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  sample.txt
Documents  Music      Public    Videos
```

Only the files confirmed with `y` were deleted.

### Best Practice

When deleting multiple files:

```bash
rm -i filename
```

Using `-i` reduces the risk of accidental data loss.

# 8.6.1 Removing Directories

Directories can also be removed using the `rm` command. However, by default, `rm` does **not** remove directories.

---

## Attempting to Remove a Directory Without Options

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm Videos
rm: cannot remove `Videos': Is a directory
```

The system refuses to remove the directory because it requires special permission to delete directories.

---

## Removing Directories with `-r` (Recursive)

To delete a directory and all of its contents, use the `-r` option:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  sample.txt
Documents  Music      Public    Videos

sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm -r Videos

sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  sample.txt
```

### What Does `-r` Do?

The `-r` option means **recursive**. It:

* Deletes the directory
* Deletes all files inside it
* Deletes all subdirectories inside it
* Deletes everything within those subdirectories

⚠ When using `rm -r`, all contents are deleted **without interactive questions** unless `-i` is also used.

### Safer Alternative

Combine both options:

```bash
rm -ri directoryname
```

This prompts before deleting files and subdirectories.

---

## Using `rmdir` to Remove Empty Directories

The `rmdir` command can remove a directory, but only if it is empty.

### Example

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rmdir Documents
rmdir: failed to remove 'Documents': Directory not empty
```

Because `Documents` contains files or subdirectories, it cannot be removed with `rmdir`.

### Key Difference

| Command | Removes Files | Removes Non-Empty Directories |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `rm`    | Yes           | Yes (with `-r`)               |
| `rmdir` | No            | Only if empty                 |

# Summary

## Removing Files

* Use `rm filename`
* Files are permanently deleted
* No trash can
* No undelete command

## Safe Deletion

* Use `rm -i` to confirm before deletion
* Especially important when using wildcards (`*`)

## Removing Directories

* `rm directory` → Will not work
* `rm -r directory` → Deletes directory and all contents
* `rmdir directory` → Only works if directory is empty

---

# Key Takeaways

* The `rm` command is powerful and irreversible.
* Always double-check your directory before running `rm`.
* Use the `-i` option when deleting multiple files.
* Use `rm -r` carefully — it deletes everything inside a directory.
* `rmdir` is safer but limited to empty directories.

Understanding how to properly remove files and directories is critical for effective and safe file management in Linux.
