# 8.7 Creating Directories

In Linux, directories (also called folders) are used to organize files and other directories. Creating directories allows users to structure data logically and maintain an orderly file system.

To create a directory from the command line, use the `mkdir` command.

---

## Creating a Directory with `mkdir`

The `mkdir` command stands for **make directory**.

### Example

First, list the current contents of the directory:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  sample.txt
```

Create a new directory named `test`:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ mkdir test
```

Verify that the directory was created:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates   test
Documents  Music      Public    sample.txt
```

Notice that the new directory `test` now appears in the directory listing.

## Understanding What Happened

* Before running `mkdir`, the directory `test` did not exist.
* After running `mkdir test`, a new directory named `test` was created in the current working directory.
* The `ls` command confirms the directory was successfully created.

---

## Key Points About `mkdir`

* `mkdir` creates a new directory in the current location.
* If the directory already exists, the command will return an error.
* The directory name is case-sensitive (for example, `Test` and `test` would be different directories).
* You must have permission to create directories in the current location.

# Summary

## Command to Create a Directory

```bash
mkdir directory_name
```

## Steps to Create and Verify

1. Use `ls` to view current contents.
2. Use `mkdir directory_name` to create the directory.
3. Use `ls` again to confirm creation.

Creating directories is a fundamental skill in Linux file management, as it allows users to organize files efficiently within the file system.
