# 1.3 Linux is Open Source

## 1. What is Closed-Source Software?

Historically, most software was distributed under a **closed-source license**.

This means:

* Users receive only the **machine code** (the compiled version).
* The **source code** is hidden.
* You are allowed to use the software.
* You are NOT allowed to see how it works internally.
* Licenses often forbid reverse engineering the code.

In simple terms:

> You can use it, but you cannot study it, change it, or improve it.

Closed-source software limits transparency and collaboration.

## 2. What is Open Source Software?

Open source software takes a **source-centric approach**.

The open source philosophy states:

* Users have the right to access the **source code**.
* Users can modify the code.
* Users can improve it.
* Users can share improvements with others.

Instead of hiding how software works, open source promotes:

* Transparency
* Collaboration
* Community development
* Continuous improvement

## 3. Linux and the Rise of Open Source

The development of Linux closely parallels the growth of the open source movement.

When Linus Torvalds created Linux in 1991, he made the source code freely available.

This decision was critical to Linux’s success.

Because the source code was open:

* Programmers worldwide could examine it.
* Developers could fix bugs.
* Contributors could add new features.
* Improvements could be shared back with the community.

This created rapid development and innovation.

## 4. Collaborative Development Model

Linux was not the first volunteer-developed project, but it had a major advantage:

It was built **from scratch**, allowing early adopters to influence its direction.

The development process worked like this:

1. A developer downloaded the source code.
2. They made changes or improvements.
3. They shared their changes with the community.
4. The best improvements were incorporated into the system.

This collaborative model:

* Accelerated development speed.
* Reduced repeated mistakes.
* Encouraged innovation.
* Strengthened system reliability.

Over time, this model proved extremely powerful.

## 5. Linux is Written in C

The Linux kernel is written in:

* The C programming language

C is:

* Versatile
* Relatively easy to learn
* Portable across hardware platforms
* Closely related to the original UNIX

This was a crucial decision.

Because C was widely used and understood:

* More developers could contribute.
* Linux could run on different hardware.
* Adoption spread quickly.

Today, Linux is the primary operating system for many internet servers, partly due to this design choice.

## 6. Why Open Source Made Linux Successful

Linux adopted the open source philosophy early, and it led to:

* Rapid global adoption
* Strong community support
* High reliability
* Security through transparency
* Continuous innovation

Instead of relying on one company, Linux benefits from:

* Thousands of developers
* Universities
* Corporations
* Independent contributors

This collaborative ecosystem ensures Linux keeps improving.

## 7. Key Differences: Closed Source vs Open Source

| Feature                | Closed Source        | Open Source (Linux Model) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Access to Source Code  | Not available        | Fully available           |
| Modification Rights    | Not allowed          | Allowed                   |
| Transparency           | Limited              | High                      |
| Community Contribution | Rare                 | Encouraged                |
| Innovation Speed       | Controlled by vendor | Community-driven          |

## 8. Key Takeaways

* Closed-source software hides the source code.
* Open source allows users to view and modify the source code.
* Linux embraced open source from the beginning.
* Collaboration accelerated Linux’s development.
* Linux is written in C, contributing to its portability and success.
* Open source is a major reason Linux became dominant in internet infrastructure.

---

# Summary

Linux is open source, meaning:

* Its source code is freely available.
* Anyone can study, modify, and improve it.
* Development is community-driven.
* Transparency strengthens security and reliability.
* The choice to write Linux in C supported its widespread adoption.

Open source is not just a licensing model — it is a philosophy of shared knowledge and collaborative progress that transformed Linux into one of the most important technologies in the world.
