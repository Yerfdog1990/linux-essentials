# 1.2 Linux is a Kernel

---

## 1. What Does “Linux” Really Mean?

The definition of **Linux** depends on the context in which the word is used.

### Two Common Meanings:

1. **Linux = The Kernel**
2. **Linux = The Operating System (GNU/Linux)**

Strictly speaking, Linux refers to the **kernel**, which is the central controller of everything that happens on a computer.

---

## 2. What is a Kernel?

The **kernel** is the core part of an operating system.

It:

* Is loaded at **boot time**
* Remains running while the system operates
* Manages hardware
* Controls processes
* Handles memory
* Coordinates input and output

Think of the kernel as:

> The “brain” or central manager of the entire computer system.

Without the kernel, the operating system cannot function.

## 3. GNU/Linux: The Complete Operating System

When most people say “Linux,” they actually mean **GNU/Linux**.

GNU/Linux consists of:

* **GNU tools** (utilities, compilers, editors, commands)
* **Linux kernel** (core system controller)

### The GNU Project

The GNU Project was created in 1983 by Richard Stallman.

Its goal was to build a free, open-source operating system.

Although GNU did not fully complete its own kernel, it successfully created:

* Command-line tools
* Compilers
* Text editors
* User interfaces
* System utilities

These GNU tools made it possible to build a complete operating system around the Linux kernel.

That is why the full operating system is more accurately called **GNU/Linux**.

## 4. The Origins: UNIX

The story of Linux begins with UNIX.

UNIX was:

* Developed in the 1970s at AT&T Bell Labs
* Written in the **C programming language**
* Highly portable (could run on different hardware)
* Popular in universities and research institutions
* Attractive to programmers because of its modular design

Over time:

* UNIX was modified and forked into many variants.
* It became both a **trademark and a specification**.
* Only systems certified by The Open Group can officially call themselves UNIX.

Important note:

> Linux is not certified UNIX.
> Linux is UNIX-like.

## 5. The Birth of Linux

Linux began in 1991 as a hobby project by:

Linus Torvalds

He was:

* A Finnish-born computer science student
* Studying at the University of Helsinki

Linus was frustrated with:

* The licensing restrictions of MINIX
* Its limited purpose as only an educational operating system

So he decided to create his own operating system kernel.

From that small personal project, Linux grew into:

* The dominant operating system on the Internet
* The foundation of cloud computing
* One of the most important programs ever created

---

## 6. Why Linux Isn’t UNIX

Although Linux:

* Follows UNIX design principles
* Meets many UNIX specifications
* Behaves like UNIX

It is not officially UNIX because:

* It has not been certified by The Open Group.
* UNIX is a registered trademark.

Therefore:

> Linux is UNIX-like, but not UNIX.

---

## 7. The Role of GNU in Linux’s Success

Linux alone is just a kernel.

It needed:

* Tools
* Commands
* Interfaces
* Compilers
* Utilities

The GNU Project provided these components.

Because GNU software was open source:

* Linux developers could combine GNU tools with the Linux kernel.
* A complete operating system was formed.

Many commands used in Linux today evolved from early GNU tools.

## 8. Interesting Facts

### The Name Linux

Originally, Linus Torvalds wanted to call his project **Freax**.

However:

* An administrator managing the development server renamed it “Linux.”
* The name combines **Linus + UNIX**.
* The name stuck.

### What Does GNU Mean?

GNU stands for:

> **“GNU’s Not Unix”**

It is a recursive acronym.

GNU is pronounced like the African antelope “gnu,” which inspired its logo.

---

## 9. Key Takeaways

* Linux technically refers to the **kernel**.
* GNU provides the tools that make the kernel usable.
* Together, they form **GNU/Linux**.
* Linux evolved from UNIX principles.
* Linux is UNIX-like, but not certified UNIX.
* Linux started as a student hobby project.
* Today, Linux dominates the Internet and modern computing.

---

# Summary

Linux is:

* A kernel
* The heart of an operating system
* Combined with GNU tools to form GNU/Linux
* Inspired by UNIX
* Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991
* One of the most important technologies in computing history

Understanding that Linux is a kernel helps you better understand how operating systems are structured and how modern computing systems function.
