# 6.4 Info Documentation

While **man pages** are excellent reference tools, they have some limitations:

* Each man page is a separate, independent document
* They are not deeply connected to one another
* They are primarily designed as quick reference material

Although some man pages include a **SEE ALSO** section, they are generally standalone documents.

To address these limitations, Linux provides another documentation system: **Info**.

---

## What Is Info Documentation?

The `info` command provides documentation for:

* Operating system commands
* System features
* GNU utilities

However, the goal of Info documentation is slightly different from man pages.

### Key Differences from Man Pages

| Man Pages             | Info Documentation                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Separate documents    | Organized into a single structured "book" |
| Reference-focused     | Learning-focused                          |
| Minimal cross-linking | Hyperlinked and structured                |
| Concise               | More detailed and tutorial-like           |

Think of:

* **Man pages** → Quick reference manual
* **Info documents** → Structured learning guide

---

## How Info Is Organized

All Info documentation is merged into a single hierarchical structure that behaves like a book:

* Divided into **nodes**
* Contains **categories**
* Includes **menus**
* Uses **hyperlinks**
* Has a table-of-contents style structure

This logical organization makes reading and exploring documentation easier.

---

# 6.4.1 Viewing Info Documentation

To view Info documentation:

```bash
info command
```

### Example (Console Log)

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ info ls
```

Sample output:

```
Next: dir invocation,  Up: Directory listing

10.1 `ls': List directory contents
==================================

    The `ls' program lists information about files (of any type, including directories).  Options and file arguments can be intermixed arbitrarily, as usual.

    For non-option command-line arguments that are directories, by default `ls' lists the contents of directories, not recursively, and omitting files with names beginning with `.'.

    If no non-option argument is specified, `ls' operates on the current directory, acting as if it had been invoked with a single argument of `.'.
```

At the bottom:

```
-----Info: (coreutils)ls invocation, 57 lines --Top-----------------------------
Welcome to Info version 6.5.  Type H for help, h for tutorial.
```

---

## Understanding the Structure

The line:

```
-----Info: (coreutils)ls invocation, 57 lines --Top-----------------------------
```

Shows:

* The document name: `coreutils`
* The current node: `ls invocation`
* The position within the node: `--Top--`

---

## Nodes and Navigation

Info documentation is divided into **nodes**, similar to chapters in a book.

At the top of the `ls` page:

```
Next: dir invocation,  Up: Directory listing
```

This means:

* **Next** → Next chapter/node
* **Up** → Move up one level in the hierarchy

---

## Menus and Hyperlinks

Scrolling down reveals a menu:

```
* Menu:

* Which files are listed::
* What information is listed::
* Sorting the output::
* Details about version sort::
* General output formatting::
* Formatting file timestamps::
* Formatting the file names::
```

These menu entries are **hyperlinks**.

To follow a link:

1. Move the cursor to the item
2. Press **Enter**

---

### Example: Entering a Sub-node

If you select:

```
* Sorting the output::
```

You see:

```
10.1.3 Sorting the output
-------------------------

These options change the order in which 'ls' sorts the information it outputs.
By default, sorting is done by character code (e.g., ASCII order).
```

Notice:

```
Next: Details about version sort,  Prev: What information is listed,  Up: ls invocation
```

This confirms:

* You are inside a sub-node
* You can move between related nodes

---

## Returning from a Node

There are two important navigation keys:

| Key | Function                    |
| --- | --------------------------- |
| `u` | Go up one level             |
| `l` | Return to previous location |

Difference:

* `u` → Goes to the start of the parent node
* `l` → Returns exactly to where you were before

---

# 6.4.2 Navigating Info Documents

To see available navigation commands, press:

```
Shift + H
```

This displays the Info help screen:

```
Basic Info command keys

l           Close this help window.
q           Quit Info altogether.
h           Invoke the Info tutorial.

Up          Move up one line.
Down        Move down one line.
PgUp        Scroll backward one screenful.
PgDn        Scroll forward one screenful.
Home        Go to the beginning of this node.
End         Go to the end of this node.

TAB         Skip to the next hypertext link.
RET         Follow the hypertext link under the cursor.
l           Go back to the last node seen in this window.

[           Go to the previous node in the document.
]           Go to the next node in the document.
p           Go to the previous node on this level.
n           Go to the next node on this level.
u           Go up one level.
```

To:

* Close help → press `L`
* Quit Info → press `Q`

---

# 6.4.3 Exploring Info Documentation

Instead of looking up a specific command, you can explore the full documentation tree.

Run:

```bash
info
```

This opens the top-level node:

```
File: dir,  Node: Top,  This is the top of the INFO tree.

This is the Info main menu (aka directory node).

* Menu:

Basics
* Common options: (coreutils)Common options.
* Coreutils: (coreutils).       Core GNU utilities.
* Date input formats: (coreutils)Date input formats.
* File permissions: (coreutils)File permissions.
* Finding files: (find).
```

This is essentially the **table of contents** for all available documentation.

You can:

* Explore system utilities
* Learn about file permissions
* Understand command options
* Study GNU core utilities

# Summary

The `info` command:

* Provides structured documentation
* Organizes content into nodes
* Uses menus and hyperlinks
* Allows hierarchical navigation
* Encourages exploration and learning

Key commands:

| Command        | Purpose                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `info command` | View documentation for command |
| `info`         | Open top-level documentation   |
| `TAB`          | Move between links             |
| `RET`          | Follow link                    |
| `u`            | Go up                          |
| `l`            | Go back                        |
| `Q`            | Quit                           |

While man pages are essential for quick reference, Info documentation provides a more structured and educational way to learn Linux commands and features.
