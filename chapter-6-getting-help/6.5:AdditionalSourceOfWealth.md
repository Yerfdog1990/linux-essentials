# 6.5 Additional Sources of Help

While **man pages** and **info documentation** are powerful and often sufficient, Linux provides additional ways to get help directly from the system. Knowing multiple help sources allows you to quickly find answers without interrupting your workflow.

# 6.5.1 Using the `--help` Option

Many Linux commands include a built-in help option that provides a quick summary of how the command works.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
command --help
```

This option:

* Displays basic usage information
* Shows available options
* Provides short descriptions of each option
* Often includes examples
* Does not require leaving the command line

It is similar to the **SYNOPSIS** section of a man page, but faster and more convenient when you only need a quick reminder.

---

## Example: `cat --help`

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat --help
```

Output:

```text
Usage: cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

  -A, --show-all           equivalent to -vET
  -b, --number-nonblank    number nonempty output lines, overrides -n
  -e                       equivalent to -vE
  -E, --show-ends          display $ at end of each line
  -n, --number             number all output lines
  -s, --squeeze-blank      suppress repeated empty output lines
  -t                       equivalent to -vT
  -T, --show-tabs          display TAB characters as ^I
  -u                       (ignored)
  -v, --show-nonprinting   use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB
      --help               display this help and exit
      --version            output version information and exit

Examples:
  cat f - g  Output f's contents, then standard input, then g's contents.
  cat        Copy standard input to standard output.
```

## What This Tells Us

From the help output, we can quickly learn:

* The command structure:
  `cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...`

* The purpose:
  Concatenates (combines) files and prints them to standard output.

* Common options:

    * `-n` → Number all lines
    * `-b` → Number non-empty lines
    * `-s` → Remove repeated blank lines
    * `-E` → Show end-of-line markers
    * `--version` → Show version information

* Usage examples are provided at the bottom.

## Advantages of `--help`

* Fast access to basic information
* No need to open man or info
* Ideal for quick reminders
* Available on most GNU/Linux commands

## When to Use `--help`

| Situation             | Best Tool |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| Quick syntax reminder | `--help`  |
| Detailed explanation  | `man`     |
| Structured learning   | `info`    |

# 6.5.2 Additional System Documentation

Beyond built-in help tools, Linux systems often include additional documentation files stored on the system.

These files are typically:

* Provided by software developers
* Installed alongside applications
* Designed to explain setup and advanced configuration

---

## README Files

These documentation files are commonly called **README files**.

Typical filenames include:

* `README`
* `readme.txt`
* `README.md`

These files often contain:

* Installation instructions
* Configuration guidance
* Troubleshooting tips
* Licensing information
* Feature explanations

---

## Where to Find Documentation Files

The location depends on the Linux distribution, but common directories include:

```bash
/usr/share/doc
/usr/doc
```

For example:

```bash
ls /usr/share/doc
```

This directory may contain subdirectories for installed packages, each with their own documentation.

---

## Who Uses This Documentation?

### System Administrators

* Setting up complex services
* Configuring servers
* Troubleshooting advanced issues

### Regular Users

* Learning how software works
* Understanding configuration options
* Reading examples and usage notes

# Key Takeaways

1. Linux provides multiple built-in help tools.
2. The `--help` option is the fastest way to check command usage.
3. Man pages provide detailed reference information.
4. Info documentation offers structured learning.
5. Additional documentation files are often stored in `/usr/share/doc`.
6. Knowing where to look for help is an essential Linux skill.

Being able to efficiently find and use help resources makes working in Linux far more productive and less confusing, especially given the large number of commands and available options.
