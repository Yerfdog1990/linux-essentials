## 6.2 Man Pages

Linux was modeled after the UNIX operating system. UNIX developers created built-in documentation called **man pages** (short for *manual pages*). These documents remain one of the most important help systems in Linux.

Man pages describe:

* The purpose of commands
* Available options
* Syntax and usage
* Related files
* Additional references

They serve as an essential built-in documentation system for Linux users.

# 6.2.1 Viewing Man Pages

To view the manual page for a command, use:

```bash
man command
```

### Example (Console Log)

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ man ls
```

Output begins like this:

```
LS(1)                            User Commands                           LS(1)

NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).
       Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort  is  speci-
       fied.

       Mandatory  arguments  to  long  options are mandatory for short options
       too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .
```

---

### Navigating a Man Page

Man pages are displayed using a **pager** program:

* Usually `less`
* Sometimes `more`

Navigation keys:

| Key   | Function           |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| ↑ / ↓ | Scroll up/down     |
| Q     | Quit               |
| H     | Display pager help |
| /     | Search             |

Pressing **Q** exits the man page.

Pressing **H** shows movement commands available in the pager.

---

# 6.2.2 Sections Within Man Pages

Man pages are structured into sections. Not every page contains all sections, but most include common ones.

---

## NAME

Provides:

* Command name
* Brief description

Example:

```
NAME
       ls - list directory contents
```

---

## SYNOPSIS

Shows how to execute the command.

Example:

```
SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

The SYNOPSIS is concise but very important.

---

### Understanding SYNOPSIS Notation

#### 1. Square Brackets `[ ]`

Indicate optional components.

Example from the `cal` command:

```
SYNOPSIS
     cal [-31jy] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [[month] year]
```

Meaning:

* `[-31jy]` → Options -3, -1, -j, or -y are optional.
* `[[month] year]` →

    * A year may be specified alone.
    * A month requires a year.

---

#### 2. Ellipsis `...`

Example:

```
ls [OPTION]...
```

The `...` means one or more of the preceding items may be used.

---

#### 3. Vertical Bar `|`

Example from `date`:

```
SYNOPSIS
       date [OPTION]... [+FORMAT]
       date [-u|--utc|--universal] [MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]]
```

Meaning:

* `-u` OR `--utc` OR `--universal` may be used.
* These usually perform the same function.
* The `|` represents logical “or.”

This example also shows two different usages:

1. Display the system date
2. Set the system date

---

## DESCRIPTION

Provides detailed explanation of what the command does.

Example:

```
DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about  the FILEs (the current directory by default).
       Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort  is  speci-
       fied.
```

---

## OPTIONS

Lists available options and explains them.

Example:

```
-a, --all
       do not ignore entries starting with .

-A, --almost-all
       do not list implied . and ..

--author
       with -l, print the author of each file

-b, --escape
       print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

--block-size=SIZE
       scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g., '--block-size=M'
       prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes
```

Sometimes option explanations appear inside the DESCRIPTION instead of a separate OPTIONS section.

---

## FILES

Describes files used or affected by the command.

These may include:

* Configuration files
* Data files
* System files

Sometimes this section is integrated into DESCRIPTION.

---

## AUTHOR

Example:

```
AUTHOR
       Written by Richard M. Stallman and David MacKenzie.
```

Indicates who wrote the man page.

---

## REPORTING BUGS

Example:

```
REPORTING BUGS
       GNU coreutils online help: <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>
       Report ls translation bugs to <http://translationproject.org/team/>
```

Provides information on how to report issues.

---

## COPYRIGHT

Example:

```
COPYRIGHT
       Copyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
       License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.
       This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.

```

## SEE ALSO

Example:

```

       Full documentation at: <http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/ls>
       or available locally via: info '(coreutils) ls invocation'
```

Lists related commands or further documentation.

# 6.2.3 Searching Man Pages

To search inside a man page:

1. Press `/`
2. Type search term
3. Press Enter

If found, the term is highlighted.

Navigation:

| Key     | Function       |
| ------- | -------------- |
| n       | Next match     |
| Shift+N | Previous match |

If not found:

```
Pattern not found (press Return)
```

# 6.2.4 Man Pages Categorized by Sections

There are thousands of man pages, so they are organized into sections.

### Default Nine Sections

1. General Commands
2. System Calls
3. Library Calls
4. Special Files
5. File Formats and Conventions
6. Games
7. Miscellaneous
8. System Administration Commands
9. Kernel Routines

When you run:

```bash
man cal
```

The system searches section 1 first, then section 2, and so on.

---

### Example: No Manual Entry

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ man zed
No manual entry for zed
```

---

### Identifying the Section Number

Example:

```
CAL(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual             CAL(1)
```

The `(1)` indicates section 1 (General Commands).

---

## Multiple Man Pages with the Same Name

Example: `passwd`

There is:

* A command `passwd`
* A file `passwd`

Search for matching entries:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ man -f passwd
passwd (5)           - the password file
passwd (1)           - change user password
passwd (1ssl)        - compute password hashes
```

Note:

* On most systems, `whatis` does the same as `man -f`.

---

### Viewing a Specific Section

To open section 5 of passwd:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ man 5 passwd
PASSWD(5)                File Formats and Conversions          PASSWD(5)
```

This displays documentation for the **passwd file**, not the command.

---

## Searching by Keyword

If you do not remember the exact name:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ man -k copy
```

Example output:

```
cp (1)               - copy files and directories
cpgr (8)             - copy with locking the given file to the password or gr...
cpio (1)             - copy files to and from archives
cppw (8)             - copy with locking the given file to the password or gr...
dd (1)               - convert and copy a file
debconf-copydb (1)   - copy a debconf database
install (1)          - copy files and set attributes
scp (1)              - secure copy (remote file copy program)
ssh-copy-id (1)      - use locally available keys to authorize logins on a re...
```

Note:

* `apropos` performs the same function as `man -k` on most systems.

Be specific when searching. Using generic words may return hundreds of results.

---

# Summary

Man pages are:

* Built-in Linux documentation
* Organized into structured sections
* Categorized into nine numbered groups
* Fully searchable
* Accessible directly from the terminal

Essential commands:

| Command               | Purpose               |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `man command`         | View manual           |
| `man -f name`         | Find exact matches    |
| `man -k keyword`      | Search by keyword     |
| `man section command` | View specific section |
| `/term`               | Search within page    |
| `Q`                   | Quit                  |

Mastering man pages is one of the most important Linux skills because they provide immediate, detailed documentation for thousands of commands directly from the command line.
