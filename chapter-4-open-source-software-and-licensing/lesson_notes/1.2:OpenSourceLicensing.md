## 4.2 Open Source Licensing

When discussing software licensing, it is important to understand that there are **three distinct components** involved in acquiring and using software:

### 1. Ownership

* Who owns the intellectual property (IP) behind the software?
* Typically, the individual developer or company that created the software retains ownership under copyright law.

### 2. Money Transfer

* How does payment occur, if at all?
* Some software requires payment (commercial model).
* Some software is distributed freely.
* The business model determines how money changes hands.

### 3. Licensing

* What rights are granted to the user?
* Can the software be installed on multiple computers?
* Can it be copied or shared?
* Can it be modified?
* Is reverse engineering allowed?

It is **licensing**, more than ownership or payment, that distinguishes **open source software** from **closed source software**.

## Closed Source Licensing: Microsoft Windows Example

Consider **Microsoft Windows**:

* **Ownership**: The intellectual property belongs to the Microsoft Corporation.
* **License Agreement**: Users must accept an **End User License Agreement (EULA)** before installation.
* **Source Code**: Not provided. Only binary (compiled) copies are distributed.
* **Usage Restrictions**:

    * Usually licensed for installation on one computer.
    * Copying is restricted (except for backup purposes).
    * Reverse engineering is prohibited.
* **Payment Model**:

    * You pay for a licensed copy.
    * Minor updates may be included.
    * Major upgrades typically require additional payment.

In this model:

* Users receive permission to use the software.
* They do not gain ownership of the software.
* They do not gain access to the source code.
* They cannot legally modify or redistribute it.

## Open Source Licensing: Linux and GPLv2

Linux provides a contrasting example.

* **Ownership**: Linux is owned by Linus Torvalds.
* **License**: Released under the **GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)**.
* **Source Code Access**:

    * Must be made available to anyone who requests it.
* **Modification Rights**:

    * Anyone can modify the code.
* **Redistribution Rules**:

    * If you distribute modified versions, you must:

        * Release your changes under the same license (GPLv2).
* **Charging for Distribution**:

    * You may only charge for actual distribution costs (e.g., copying to media).
    * You cannot charge simply for access to the source code.

### Key Concept: Copyleft

GPLv2 includes a principle known as **copyleft**, which ensures:

* Freedom to use.
* Freedom to modify.
* Freedom to redistribute.
* Obligation to keep those freedoms intact for others.

Once Linus Torvalds released Linux under GPLv2, he gave up the right to restrict its use. Even though he owns the copyright, he cannot prevent others from using, modifying, or distributing Linux within the license terms.

## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)

**Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** refers to software where the creator has granted broad rights to the public, including:

* Viewing the source code.
* Modifying it.
* Redistributing it.

“Free” in this context refers to **freedom**, not necessarily price.

FOSS licensing represents a deliberate decision by creators to give up certain exclusive rights in favor of community collaboration and transparency.

## Licensing as a Political and Philosophical Issue

Software licensing is not just a technical matter—it is also:

* Political
* Philosophical
* Economic

Different groups have different views about:

* How much freedom users should have.
* Whether modifications must remain open.
* Whether commercial use should be restricted.

Because of these differing philosophies, many organizations have created their own licenses rather than inventing new ones each time.

## Examples of Open Source Licenses and Organizations

Various institutions and projects have developed widely used licenses:

* **MIT License** (from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)

    * Permissive and flexible.
    * Allows reuse with minimal restrictions.

* **BSD Licenses** (University of California)

    * Similar to MIT.
    * Permits redistribution and modification with few conditions.

* **Apache License** (Apache Foundation)

    * Allows modification and redistribution.
    * Includes explicit patent protections.

* **GNU Licenses** (Free Software Foundation)

    * Designed to ensure software freedom.
    * Includes GPL variants that enforce copyleft principles.

Each license reflects the values and goals of the organization that created it.

## Comparing Closed Source and Open Source Licensing

| Feature             | Closed Source (e.g., Windows) | Open Source (e.g., Linux GPLv2)      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Source Code Access  | Not available                 | Must be available                    |
| Modification        | Not allowed                   | Allowed                              |
| Redistribution      | Restricted                    | Allowed (under license terms)        |
| Reverse Engineering | Prohibited                    | Not restricted                       |
| Ownership           | Retained by company           | Retained, but rights broadly granted |
| Upgrade Model       | Paid major upgrades           | Community-driven updates             |

## Why Licensing Matters

Licensing determines:

* Who controls software.
* How innovation spreads.
* Whether users are consumers or contributors.
* Whether improvements benefit everyone or remain private.

Open source licensing has enabled:

* Global collaboration.
* Faster innovation cycles.
* Transparent security practices.
* Reduced vendor lock-in.

Understanding licensing is essential to understanding how Linux and other open source projects have transformed the software industry.

### Key Takeaway

Ownership determines who created the software.
Money transfer determines how it is sold or distributed.
Licensing determines what you are allowed to do with it.

In open source software, licensing is the foundation that guarantees freedom, collaboration, and shared progress.
