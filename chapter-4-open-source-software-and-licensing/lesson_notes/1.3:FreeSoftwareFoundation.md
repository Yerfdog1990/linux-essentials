## 4.2.1 The Free Software Foundation (FSF)

Two of the most influential organizations in the open source world are:

* The **Free Software Foundation (FSF)**
* The Open Source Initiative (OSI)

This section focuses on the Free Software Foundation and its philosophy, goals, and licensing impact.

## 1. Origins of the Free Software Foundation

The **Free Software Foundation (FSF)** was founded in **1985** by **Richard Stallman**, only a few years after he began the GNU Project in 1983.

The FSF was created to promote the concept of **free software**.

### What Does “Free” Mean?

In the context of the FSF:

* “Free” does **not** mean zero cost.
* It refers to **freedom**.

Specifically, the freedom to:

* Share software
* Study the source code
* Modify the program
* Redistribute copies

According to the FSF’s philosophy, users should have:

> Control over the technology they use in their homes, schools, and businesses.

This idea places user rights at the center of software development.

## 2. The Philosophy of Copyleft

One of the most important contributions of the FSF is the concept of **copyleft**.

### What Is Copyleft?

Copyleft is:

* A legal method for ensuring software remains free (in terms of freedom).
* A mechanism that requires modified versions of a program to remain free as well.

According to the FSF:

> Copyleft is a general method for making a program free and requiring all modified and extended versions to be free as well.

### How Copyleft Works

If someone:

1. Takes free software,
2. Modifies it,
3. Redistributes it,

They must:

* Release the modified version under the same license.
* Provide access to the source code.
* Preserve the same freedoms for future users.

This prevents companies or individuals from taking free software, improving it, and then turning it into closed, proprietary software.

## 3. Advocacy and Activism

The FSF is not just a licensing organization—it is also an advocacy group.

### Areas of Advocacy

1. **Opposition to Software Patents**

    * Software patents can restrict innovation and limit collaboration.
    * The FSF believes they conflict with free software principles.

2. **Standards Oversight**

    * The FSF monitors standards organizations.
    * It speaks out if proposed standards include:

        * Digital Rights Management (DRM)
        * Restrictions that limit user freedom
        * Requirements incompatible with free software

### Digital Rights Management (DRM)

The FSF is particularly critical of DRM because:

* It restricts what users can do with software.
* It limits modification and redistribution.
* It reduces user control over technology.

From the FSF’s perspective, DRM contradicts the principles of software freedom.

## 4. GNU Licenses Developed by the FSF

The FSF has created and maintains several influential licenses, all based on the original **GNU General Public License (GPL)**.

### Major FSF Licenses

1. **GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2)**
2. **GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)**
3. **GNU Lesser General Public License version 2 (LGPLv2)**
4. **GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 (LGPLv3)**

These licenses are:

* Free to use.
* Intended to be included directly in the source code.
* Designed to legally protect software freedom.

### Purpose of These Licenses

They ensure that:

* Future versions of the software maintain the same freedoms.
* Modifications cannot be closed off.
* Users retain the right to study, modify, and share the software.

The GPL and its variants have become powerful legal tools that support the global free software movement.

What began in 1983 as one person’s desire to share software has influenced:

* Operating systems (like Linux),
* Development tools,
* Servers,
* Embedded systems,
* And much of the modern Internet.

## 5. GPLv2 vs. GPLv3: The Issue of Tivoization

One of the major differences between GPLv2 and GPLv3 relates to a concept known as **Tivoization**.

### What Is Tivoization?

Tivoization refers to a situation where:

* A company uses GPL-licensed software (such as Linux),
* Releases the required source code,
* But designs hardware that refuses to run modified versions of the software.

The term comes from **TiVo**, a company that built digital video recorders using Linux as a base.

Although TiVo:

* Released the source code (as required under GPLv2),

Their hardware:

* Would not run modified binaries.

### The FSF’s Response

The FSF believed this violated the spirit of the GPLv2.

In response, they added a clause in **GPLv3** requiring that:

* If a device runs GPLv3 software,
* Users must be able to install and run modified versions on that device.

### Linus Torvalds’ Position

Linus Torvalds disagreed with this change and:

* Chose to keep Linux licensed under GPLv2.
* Did not adopt GPLv3 for the Linux kernel.

This illustrates how licensing decisions can reflect differing philosophical viewpoints—even among major open source leaders.

## 6. The Impact of the FSF

The Free Software Foundation has:

* Shaped the legal framework of free software.
* Defined the meaning of software freedom.
* Provided widely adopted licenses.
* Influenced global technology policy discussions.

Its emphasis on:

* User control,
* Transparency,
* Shared improvements,
* Legal protection of freedoms,

has deeply influenced the development of Linux and the broader open source ecosystem.

## Key Takeaways

* The FSF was founded in 1985 by Richard Stallman.
* “Free” refers to freedom, not price.
* Copyleft ensures that modified software remains free.
* The GPL family of licenses protects user freedoms legally.
* GPLv3 addressed Tivoization; Linux remains under GPLv2.
* The FSF continues to advocate for software freedom worldwide.

The Free Software Foundation transformed software licensing from a purely legal issue into a global movement centered on user rights and technological freedom.
