## 4.2.3 Creative Commons

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) licenses were originally designed for **software**. While some people have applied FOSS licenses to non-software works such as:

* Drawings
* Documents
* Blueprints
* Educational materials

this was not their original intent. Software licenses address issues specific to code, such as compiling, linking, and redistribution of binaries.

To better address licensing for **creative and non-software works**, the **Creative Commons (CC)** organization was established.

---

## 1. Public Domain and Copyright

Before understanding Creative Commons, it is important to understand **public domain**.

### Public Domain

When a work is placed in the **public domain**:

* The author relinquishes all rights.
* Copyright protections no longer apply.
* Anyone may use, modify, or distribute the work without restriction.

In some countries:

* Government-created works automatically enter the public domain.
* Copyright expires after the author has died and a lengthy waiting period has passed.

However, many creators want to share their work **without completely giving up all rights**. Creative Commons licenses were created to provide flexible middle-ground options.

---

## 2. Purpose of Creative Commons (CC)

The **Creative Commons organization** created a set of licenses specifically for:

* Non-software works
* Art
* Music
* Photography
* Videos
* Educational materials
* Written content

Creative Commons licenses are designed to:

* Encourage sharing.
* Allow creators to retain certain rights.
* Clearly communicate how others may use the work.

Unlike most FOSS licenses, Creative Commons licenses can:

* Restrict commercial use.
* Restrict modifications.
* Require attribution.
* Enforce “share alike” conditions.

---

## 3. Core Creative Commons Conditions

Creative Commons licenses are built from combinations of four main conditions.

### 1. Attribution (BY)

* All Creative Commons licenses require attribution.
* Users must credit the creator.
* Credit must not imply endorsement by the creator.

This is the foundation of all CC licenses.

---

### 2. ShareAlike (SA)

* Others may copy, distribute, perform, and modify the work.
* However, they must license their derivative works under the same terms.

This is similar to **copyleft** in free software licenses like GPL.

---

### 3. NonCommercial (NC)

* Others may distribute, display, perform, and modify the work.
* But not for commercial purposes.

This gives creators control over commercial exploitation.

---

### 4. NoDerivatives (ND)

* Others may distribute and display only original copies.
* They may not modify or create derivative works.
* Permission must be obtained for changes.

This protects the integrity of the original work.

---

## 4. The Six Main Creative Commons Licenses

By combining these four conditions, Creative Commons offers six primary licenses.

---

### 1. Attribution (CC BY)

* Allows any use (including commercial).
* Modifications are allowed.
* Must provide credit to the creator.

This license is similar in spirit to permissive software licenses like BSD or MIT.

---

### 2. Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)

* Allows commercial use.
* Allows modification.
* Requires attribution.
* Requires derivative works to be licensed under the same terms.

This is comparable to a **copyleft** software license like GPL.

---

### 3. Attribution-NoDerivs (CC BY-ND)

* Allows redistribution.
* Allows commercial use.
* Requires attribution.
* Does not allow modification.

Users may share the work, but not alter it.

---

### 4. Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)

* Allows modification.
* Requires attribution.
* Prohibits commercial use.

The work can be shared and adapted, but not sold or used for profit.

---

### 5. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)

* Requires attribution.
* Prohibits commercial use.
* Requires derivative works to use the same license.

This combines NonCommercial with ShareAlike restrictions.

---

### 6. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND)

* Requires attribution.
* Prohibits commercial use.
* Prohibits modification.

This is the most restrictive of the six main CC licenses.

---

## 5. CC0 – No Rights Reserved

Creative Commons also provides:

### CC0 (Creative Commons Zero)

* A tool for dedicating work to the public domain.
* Allows anyone to use the work without restrictions.
* Equivalent to “No Rights Reserved.”

CC0 is the Creative Commons alternative to traditional public domain dedication.

## 6. Comparing Creative Commons and FOSS Licensing

| Feature                       | FOSS Licenses | Creative Commons Licenses |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Designed for                  | Software      | Non-software works        |
| Source code focus             | Yes           | No                        |
| Commercial restriction option | Usually no    | Yes (NC)                  |
| Copyleft option               | Yes (GPL)     | Yes (SA)                  |
| No-derivative option          | Rare          | Yes (ND)                  |
| Public domain option          | Limited       | Yes (CC0)                 |

Creative Commons licenses provide flexibility that traditional software licenses do not.

## 7. Why Creative Commons Matters

Creative Commons has:

* Made sharing creative works easier.
* Standardized permissions for global use.
* Enabled collaborative culture online.
* Supported education and open knowledge initiatives.

By allowing creators to choose the level of openness they are comfortable with, CC licenses bridge the gap between:

* Full copyright protection
* And complete public domain release

---

## Key Takeaways

* FOSS licenses were designed primarily for software.
* Public domain means no copyright restrictions.
* Creative Commons licenses address non-software works.
* All CC licenses require attribution (BY).
* Additional conditions (SA, NC, ND) define usage rights.
* CC0 allows full public domain dedication.

Creative Commons licensing has played a major role in enabling open culture, knowledge sharing, and creative collaboration worldwide.
