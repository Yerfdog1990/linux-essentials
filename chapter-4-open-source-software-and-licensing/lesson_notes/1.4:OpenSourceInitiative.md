## 4.2.2 The Open Source Initiative (OSI)

Alongside the Free Software Foundation (FSF), the **Open Source Initiative (OSI)** is one of the most influential organizations in the open source movement.

---

## 1. Origins of the Open Source Initiative

The **Open Source Initiative (OSI)** was founded in **1998** by:

* Bruce Perens
* Eric Raymond

They believed that:

* The FSF’s messaging was too politically charged.
* The strong copyleft requirements of FSF licenses (such as the GPL) were too restrictive for some use cases.
* A more business-friendly and less ideological approach would encourage broader adoption of open source software.

The term **“open source”** was promoted to make the movement more appealing to corporations and commercial developers.

## 2. OSI Philosophy and Principles

The OSI emphasizes:

* Free availability of source code.
* Freedom of use for any purpose.
* Minimal restrictions on redistribution.

A key principle of the OSI is that:

> No restrictions should be placed on how the software is used, regardless of its intended purpose.

This includes:

* Commercial use
* Academic use
* Government use
* Private use

Unlike the FSF, the OSI does **not** require that modifications must remain open source (unless the specific license chosen requires it).

---

## 3. OSI and Open Source Licenses

The OSI does not create its own licenses. Instead, it:

* Defines a set of principles known as the Open Source Definition.
* Reviews licenses.
* Approves licenses that comply with those principles.

These approved licenses are called **open source licenses**.

If software is distributed under an OSI-approved license, it is considered **open source software**.

## 4. BSD Licenses: A Permissive Model

One well-known example of an OSI-approved license is the **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) license**.

There are two primary BSD licenses currently approved:

* **2-Clause BSD License**
* **3-Clause BSD License**

### Key Characteristics of BSD Licenses

* You may redistribute source code and binaries.
* You must retain the original copyright notices.
* You must not claim that the original author endorses your version.

In simple terms:

> “Do what you want with this software, just don’t say you wrote it.”

BSD licenses are much simpler than GPL licenses and do not contain strong copyleft requirements.

---

### The Original BSD License Issue

According to the FSF, the original BSD license had a flaw:

* It required acknowledgment of the University of California, Berkeley in every advertisement for products using the software.

As others copied the license, they added their own acknowledgment requirements. In some cases, this resulted in over 75 required acknowledgments, creating complexity and legal overhead.

This problem led to simplified BSD license versions (2-Clause and 3-Clause) that removed the advertising requirement.

## 5. Permissive vs. Copyleft Licenses

A major distinction between FSF-style licenses and many OSI-approved licenses is the concept of **copyleft**.

### Copyleft Licenses (e.g., GPL)

* Require modified versions to remain open source.
* Enforce redistribution under the same license.
* Designed to preserve software freedom.

### Permissive Licenses (e.g., BSD, MIT)

* Allow redistribution with minimal restrictions.
* Permit inclusion in proprietary (closed source) products.
* Require attribution but not open redistribution of changes.

Because permissive licenses do not enforce copyleft, they are:

* Acceptable under OSI principles.
* Not always acceptable to the FSF’s stricter definition of free software.

For example:

* You can take BSD-licensed code,
* Modify it,
* Include it in a closed source commercial product,
* As long as proper attribution is given.

---

## 6. Relationship Between OSI and FSF

There is overlap between the two organizations:

* FSF licenses like GPLv2 are also considered open source licenses by OSI.
* However, many OSI-approved licenses (such as BSD and MIT) are considered too permissive by the FSF.

This reflects different philosophical approaches:

* FSF prioritizes protecting freedom through copyleft.
* OSI prioritizes flexibility and broad adoption.

---

## 7. FOSS, FLOSS, and Terminology

Because debates over “free software” vs. “open source” can become philosophical, the community often uses broader terms:

### FOSS – Free and Open Source Software

This term combines both perspectives to avoid ideological conflict.

However, the English word “free” is ambiguous:

* “Free as in lunch” → No cost.
* “Free as in speech” → Freedom from restriction.

To clarify this, some communities use:

### FLOSS – Free/Libre/Open Source Software

* “Libre” emphasizes freedom rather than price.
* Helps avoid confusion between cost and rights.

---

## 8. The Impact of the OSI

The Open Source Initiative has:

* Made open source licensing more accessible to businesses.
* Promoted standardization through approved licenses.
* Encouraged commercial adoption of open source software.
* Expanded the ecosystem through flexible licensing models.

By offering an alternative approach to licensing philosophy, the OSI helped accelerate corporate and enterprise adoption of open source technologies.

---

## Key Takeaways

* OSI was founded in 1998 by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond.
* It promotes open source software based on clear principles.
* It approves licenses rather than creating its own.
* BSD and MIT are examples of permissive OSI-approved licenses.
* Permissive licenses allow inclusion in proprietary products.
* FOSS and FLOSS are umbrella terms that include both FSF and OSI perspectives.

The OSI helped shift open source from a philosophical movement into a widely accepted and commercially viable development model.
