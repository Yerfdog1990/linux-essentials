## 5.3 Commands

### What is a Command?

The simplest definition of a **command** is:

> A command is a software program that, when executed on the CLI, performs an action on the computer.

When using the terminal:

1. Type the name of the command.
2. Press **Enter**.
3. The shell executes it.
4. The result (or an error message) appears in the terminal.

---

### Example: Executing a Command

Click in the terminal and type:

```
ls
```

Then press **Enter**. The result should resemble:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

By itself, the `ls` command lists files and directories contained in the **current working directory**.

At this point, do not focus too much on the output. Instead, focus on understanding how commands are formatted and executed.

(The `ls` command will be covered in complete detail later in the course.)

---

## Command Structure

Many commands can be used alone without additional input. However, some commands require extra information.

The typical format for a command is:

```
command [options] [arguments]
```

* **command** → The program to run
* **options** → Modify the behavior of the command
* **arguments** → Provide additional information (e.g., filename or username)

Each option and argument is normally separated by a space, although options can often be combined.

⚠ **Important:** Linux is **case-sensitive**.
Commands, options, arguments, variables, and file names must be entered exactly as shown.

---

# 5.3.1 Arguments

An **argument** specifies what the command should act upon.

### Example: Using One Argument

If `ls` is given a directory name as an argument, it lists the contents of that directory:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ppp                                 
ip-down.d  ip-up.d
```

Here:

* `ls` → command
* `/etc/ppp` → argument

The result is a list of files contained in that directory.

---

### Example: Using Multiple Arguments

The `ls` command also accepts multiple arguments:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ppp /etc/ssh         
/etc/ppp:                       
ip-down.d  ip-up.d                                  

/etc/ssh:                                                         
moduli               ssh_host_dsa_key.pub     ssh_host_rsa_key      sshd_configssh_config
ssh_host_ecdsa_key   ssh_host_rsa_key.pub         
ssh_host_dsa_key     ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub   ssh_import_id
```

This lists the contents of both directories.

---

# 5.3.2 Options

Options expand or modify how a command behaves.

### Example: Long Listing Option (-l)

Using the `-l` option:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l                                       
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Desktop             
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Documents           
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Downloads           
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Music               
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Pictures            
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Public               
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Templates           
drwxr-xr-x 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Jan 29  20:13 Videos  
```

Note:

* `-l` is a lowercase letter **L**
* It is mnemonic for **long listing**

It provides additional details such as:

* Permissions
* Owner
* Group
* File size
* Modification date

---

### Example: Reverse Order (-r)

By default, `ls` prints results alphabetically.

Using the `-r` option prints results in reverse alphabetical order:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -r
Videos  Templates  Public  Pictures  Music  Downloads  Documents  Desktop
```

The letter `r` is mnemonic for **reverse**.

---

## Combining Options

Options can be combined.

These all produce the same output:

```
ls -l -r
ls -rl
ls -lr
```

Example:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -lr                                                    
total 32                                                                        
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Videos                         
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Templates                      
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Public                         
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Pictures                       
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Music                          
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Downloads                      
drwxr-xr-x 4 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Documents                      
drwxr-xr-x 2 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 31 20:13 Desktop
```

The order of combined options does not matter.

---

## File Size Display

By default, `-l` shows file sizes in bytes:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/perl                         
-rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 10376 Feb  4  2018 /usr/bin/perl
```

Adding the `-h` option displays sizes in human-readable format:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -lh /usr/bin/perl                        
-rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 11K Feb  4  2018 /usr/bin/perl
```

---

## Short vs Long Options

Single-letter options:

```
-h
```

Full-word options:

```
--human-readable
```

Example:

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l --human-readable /usr/bin/perl                        
-rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 11K Feb  4  2018 /usr/bin/perl
```

* Single-letter options use one dash (`-`)
* Full-word options use two dashes (`--`)

---

# 5.3.3 History

When a command is executed, it is stored in a **history list**. This allows you to re-run commands without retyping them.

## Key Points Summary

* A command is a program executed in the CLI.

* Commands follow this structure:

  ```
  command [options] [arguments]
  ```

* Arguments specify what the command acts upon.

* Options modify how the command behaves.

* Options can be combined.

* Linux is case-sensitive.

* The history feature allows:

    * Re-execution of commands
    * Editing previous commands
    * Faster workflow
    * Reduced typing errors

Understanding commands, options, arguments, and history is essential for becoming efficient in the Linux command-line environment.
